# Sudoku Solver
`sudoku.jpynb` is a Jupyter notebook that automatically solves Sudoku puzzles using the so-called "Crook's algorithm".
`sudoku.processing.js` accomplishes the same function but within an animated environment in which the algorithm can be viewed in real time. An active notebook in which this can be viewed is available [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/graphssudoku-solver/5246379055415296).
